# Fishing-game
A JavaScript fishing game built on a website with HTML and CSS. 

Press the start button and wait for a bite.
A red exclamation point will notify you if there is a bite.
Press the reel button in time to catch the fish before the exclamation point disappears.
The program tells you what fish you caught,
and the score increases by one point every time you get a catch.
